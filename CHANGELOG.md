# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Clear button**: new toolbar button that sends `/clear` with a confirmation dialog (same UX pattern as Compact)
- **Effort: xhigh level**: added `xhigh` effort level between `high` and `max` in the effort dropdown
- **Effort picker**: "Open effort picker..." option in the effort dropdown — sends `/effort` to open Claude's native interactive slider in the terminal
- **Model picker**: "Open model picker..." option in the model dropdown — sends `/model` to open Claude's native interactive model selector in the terminal
- **Mention in Claude**: new "Mention in Claude" right-click action in the Project Explorer — inserts `@relative/path` at the terminal cursor for any file or folder

### Fixed

- **Send Selection shortcut**: selection reference (`@file:line`) is now inserted with a trailing space instead of a newliner

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **API compliance**: replaced 8 usages of internal `ActionToolbarImpl` with public `ActionManager.createActionToolbar()` API across ClaudeToolbar, DiffPanel, and HistoryPanel
- **Deprecated API**: replaced `FileChooserDescriptorFactory.createSingleFileDescriptor()` with `FileChooserDescriptor` constructor in settings

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **DiffPanel**: resolved `Write-unsafe context` error when refreshing VFS during tab selection — wrapped `VirtualFile.refresh()` in `invokeLater` for proper write-safe context

### Changed

- **Description**: rewritten plugin description for Marketplace with disclaimer, Apache 2.0 license notice, and contribution links
- **Icon**: added `pluginIcon_dark.svg` for better visibility on dark themes
- **Metadata**: removed hardcoded `<version>` from plugin.xml (now sourced solely from gradle.properties), updated vendor email

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **Compatibility**: removed upper IDE build limit (`untilBuild`) — plugin now works with IntelliJ 2024.3 and all future versions (fixes install error on 2026.1+)
- **Dependencies**: updated IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin (2.2.1 → 2.11.0), JUnit Jupiter (5.10.2 → 5.11.4), Gradle wrapper (8.10.2 → 8.13)

### Fixed

- **Actions**: added explicit `ActionUpdateThread.BGT` override to `AskClaudeAction`, `SendSelectionAction`, `ShowDiffAction`, `InsertFileReferenceAction`, and `OpenClaudeAction` (best practice for IntelliJ 241+, eliminates deprecation warnings on newer builds)

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **History**: fix project path escaping for directories containing underscores (e.g. `my_cool-project`). Claude Code replaces both `/` and `_` with `-`, but the plugin only replaced `/`. Added multi-strategy resolution with fuzzy fallback.

### Changed

- **Icon**: new minimalist diamond outline icon replacing the old "C" letter badge.
