# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] — Not yet published

### Added

- **Codex integration**: Prism now supports both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex CLI sessions from the same tool window.
- **New Session picker**: when both supported CLIs are installed, the New Session action lets you choose whether to start a Claude Code or Codex session.
- **Default agent setting**: settings now include a default CLI plus separate executable paths for Claude Code and Codex.
- **Codex conversation history**: the History panel can browse Codex sessions from `~/.codex/sessions`, filtered to the current IDE project by `cwd`.
- **Full toolbar for Codex**: the Resume, Compact, Clear, Model, Effort, and Cost buttons now work in Codex sessions, mapped to their Codex equivalents. Resume/Compact/Clear send the identical slash command; Model and Effort drive Codex's interactive `/model` picker (model list and reasoning level) via keystrokes; Cost is a dropdown that opens Codex's `/usage` token-activity view for the daily, weekly, or cumulative period.

### Changed

- **Agent Changes panel**: the changes window is now agent-agnostic, so Codex sessions use the same per-interaction snapshots, diff navigation, and revert workflow as Claude sessions.
- **Agent terminology**: user-facing actions, settings, status, and documentation now refer to Prism or the active agent where behavior applies to both Claude Code and Codex.
- **Plugin metadata**: plugin name, Marketplace description, README, and localized messages now describe support for Claude Code and Codex.

### Fixed

- **Reordering chat tabs**: dragging a tab to a new position no longer freezes it. The platform reorders a tab by removing its content and re-adding it at the new index, which Prism read as the tab being closed and used as the cue to kill that session's agent process — the tab came back with its terminal still painted but nothing running behind it. Session teardown is now tied to the tab actually being disposed, which only a real close does.

### Technical

- Codex model detection skips the `loading` placeholder Codex paints in its welcome box before the real model resolves, so the status bar shows the actual model instead of `loading` for the life of the session. The reasoning level is read from the same line, with the older separate `reasoning effort:` line kept as a fallback.
- CLI binary lookups fall back to the PATH the user's login shell exports — read once at IDE startup by the platform — instead of spawning `which` against the IDE's own environment. A GUI-launched IDE inherits that environment from the desktop session, which on macOS means launchd's `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so a CLI under `~/.local/bin`, nvm, volta, or Homebrew was invisible to the lookup even though `which` finds it in a terminal.
- Every lookup re-checks disk rather than caching: with no process to spawn, a full miss over all candidate paths and PATH entries costs tens of microseconds, so a CLI installed, upgraded in place, or removed mid-session is seen by the next New Session click with no cached answer to go stale first.
- The New Session picker takes keyboard focus while it is open, so Escape dismisses it without also reaching the agent running in the terminal behind it.
- Sessions launch the absolute binary path the availability preflight already resolved, rather than re-resolving the configured name through the login shell's PATH.
- New-session startup logs phase timings at INFO, measured monotonically: four lines greppable as `timing:` (click → availability → UI, preflight resolve, PTY spawn, first shell output), plus a launch-relative offset appended to the existing `Startup parsed` line.
- Replaced Claude-specific session, process, terminal, settings, toolbar, and tool-window classes with agent-aware equivalents.
- Split conversation history parsing behind a `HistoryReader` interface with dedicated Claude and Codex readers.
- Added shared CLI binary lookup and Codex validation services, plus tests for agent settings, Codex history parsing, toolbar availability, banner parsing, and CLI path resolution.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Ctrl+V on Linux**: now pastes whatever is on the clipboard. If the clipboard holds an image, the image bytes are written to a temporary PNG and the file path is pasted into the prompt (Claude attaches the file); otherwise the clipboard text is pasted using bracketed-paste escapes so multi-line content doesn't auto-submit. Force plain-text paste with `Ctrl+Shift+V`. macOS and Windows keep the native `Ctrl+V` paste.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Wildcard snapshot exclusions**: exclusion patterns now support `*`, `?`, and `**` (e.g. `cmake-build-*`, `**/generated`)

### Changed

- **Exclusion matching**: exact patterns (`build`, `target`, etc.) now match any path segment, so they also exclude nested directories like `src/build/`

### Fixed

- **EDT freeze**: diff computation is now dispatched to a background thread, eliminating IDE freezes on projects with many tracked files (fixes #9)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Clear button**: new toolbar button that sends `/clear` with a confirmation dialog (same UX pattern as Compact)
- **Effort: xhigh level**: added `xhigh` effort level between `high` and `max` in the effort dropdown
- **Effort picker**: "Open effort picker..." option in the effort dropdown — sends `/effort` to open Claude's native interactive slider in the terminal
- **Model picker**: "Open model picker..." option in the model dropdown — sends `/model` to open Claude's native interactive model selector in the terminal
- **Mention in Claude**: new "Mention in Claude" right-click action in the Project Explorer — inserts `@relative/path` at the terminal cursor for any file or folder

### Fixed

- **Send Selection shortcut**: selection reference (`@file:line`) is now inserted with a trailing space instead of a newliner

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **API compliance**: replaced 8 usages of internal `ActionToolbarImpl` with public `ActionManager.createActionToolbar()` API across ClaudeToolbar, DiffPanel, and HistoryPanel
- **Deprecated API**: replaced `FileChooserDescriptorFactory.createSingleFileDescriptor()` with `FileChooserDescriptor` constructor in settings

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **DiffPanel**: resolved `Write-unsafe context` error when refreshing VFS during tab selection — wrapped `VirtualFile.refresh()` in `invokeLater` for proper write-safe context

### Changed

- **Description**: rewritten plugin description for Marketplace with disclaimer, Apache 2.0 license notice, and contribution links
- **Icon**: added `pluginIcon_dark.svg` for better visibility on dark themes
- **Metadata**: removed hardcoded `<version>` from plugin.xml (now sourced solely from gradle.properties), updated vendor email

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **Compatibility**: removed upper IDE build limit (`untilBuild`) — plugin now works with IntelliJ 2024.3 and all future versions (fixes install error on 2026.1+)
- **Dependencies**: updated IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin (2.2.1 → 2.11.0), JUnit Jupiter (5.10.2 → 5.11.4), Gradle wrapper (8.10.2 → 8.13)

### Fixed

- **Actions**: added explicit `ActionUpdateThread.BGT` override to `AskClaudeAction`, `SendSelectionAction`, `ShowDiffAction`, `InsertFileReferenceAction`, and `OpenClaudeAction` (best practice for IntelliJ 241+, eliminates deprecation warnings on newer builds)

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **History**: fix project path escaping for directories containing underscores (e.g. `my_cool-project`). Claude Code replaces both `/` and `_` with `-`, but the plugin only replaced `/`. Added multi-strategy resolution with fuzzy fallback.

### Changed

- **Icon**: new minimalist diamond outline icon replacing the old "C" letter badge.
