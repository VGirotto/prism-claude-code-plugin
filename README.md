> [Leia em Português](README.pt-BR.md)

A full-featured JetBrains plugin that integrates both the **Claude Code CLI** and the **OpenAI Codex CLI** directly into your IDE — with a graphical interface, per-interaction diff view, conversation history, and multi-session support.

Prism is a **local visual wrapper** — it spawns each agent CLI via a real PTY and makes **no external API calls**. You must have the CLI(s) installed and authenticated independently.

## 🎬 Features in Action

### 🖥️ Interactive Terminal

Full agent terminal running inside the IDE with ANSI color support and real PTY (pty4j + JediTerm). Pick Claude Code or Codex when starting a new session.

Compact toolbar with quick actions: **Resume**, **Compact**, **Clear**, **Model**, **Effort**, **Cost**, **Templates**, and **Settings**. Every button works in both Claude Code and Codex sessions, mapped to each agent's own commands (for example, **Cost** runs `/cost` for Claude and opens Codex's `/usage` token-activity views).

- 📎 File reference with `@path` in the terminal
- 🎯 Auto-capture of context (active file, selection, open files)

---

### 📋 Prompt Templates & Multi-Session

Reusable [Prompt Templates](docs/prompt-templates.md) with `{selection}`, `{file}`, `{language}` variables. Run multiple simultaneous sessions in independent tabs.

---

### 🕐 Conversation History

Browse past conversations with full-text search. Resume any previous session. The history view scopes to the active session's CLI:

- **Claude** sessions are read from `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-project-path>/*.jsonl`
- **Codex** sessions are read from `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` and filtered to the IDE project by `cwd`

---

### ⚙️ Settings

Configure shell, **default agent**, **Claude path**, **Codex path**, language, exclusions, auto-start, and toggles.
Snapshot exclusions accept comma-separated names or wildcard patterns, for example `node_modules`, `cmake-build-*`, or `**/generated`.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Platform |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `Cmd+Shift+C` | Toggle Prism | macOS |
| `Alt+Shift+C` | Toggle Prism | Linux/Windows |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Show Agent Changes (diff) | macOS |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D` | Show Agent Changes (diff) | Linux/Windows |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Send selection to agent | macOS |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter` | Send selection to agent | Linux/Windows |
| `Ctrl+Shift+K` | Insert @file reference | macOS |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K` | Insert @file reference | Linux/Windows |

> On macOS, `Ctrl` refers to the physical Control key (not Cmd).

#### Paste in the agent terminal (Linux)

On Linux, `Ctrl+V` inspects the system clipboard: if it holds an image, the image bytes are written to a temporary PNG and the file path is pasted into the prompt (the agent attaches the file). Otherwise the clipboard text is pasted (wrapped in bracketed-paste escapes, so multi-line content doesn't auto-submit). Use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to force a plain-text paste. On macOS and Windows, `Ctrl+V` keeps its native agent CLI behavior.

### 🔗 Quick Access

- **IDE Menu**: `Tools > Toggle Prism`
- **Settings**: `Settings > Tools > Prism`
- **Status Bar**: Click the widget to open the agent panel
